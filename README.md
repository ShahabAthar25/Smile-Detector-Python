<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a computer vision project and trained with pretrained models from official opencv-python githubs page.
opencv-python is used all over the computer vision space and is the most used library, this project can be used anywhere the smile detection is needed such as one of the biggest example would be snapchats filters that uses smile, mouth, and face detection.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This computer vision project is made with the help of opencv-python to detect faces and smiles with pretrained models.

- [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is a computer vision project and requires basic programming knowledge such as for loops, while loops and python knowledge such as slicing, if you don't have these skills then learn these first.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to install python and and upgrade pip to the latest version.

- Pip
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShahabAthar25/Smile-Detector-Python.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirments.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This project is used in computer vision as it is designed for it, this project can be used to make filters that need face detection and smile detection. One of the most used and well known examples would be snapchats filters

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/ShahabAthar25/Smile-Detector-Python)_
